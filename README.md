# Portfolio Project 5: E-commerce applications: Django

by _James Glennon_

## About / Design

### Business model

The site is for a gym/fitness centre.

The basic model is **business to customer** _B2C_.

The product is **membership to the centre**.
A possible consideration is different tiers of membership.
(e.g. swimming only, gym only, gym and swim)

The payment model should be **recurring subscription** , with ease of cancellation being a priority to the customer.
Cancellation should not imediately remove the remainder of a customer's membership time.
Ideally, bulk once-off payment which does not automatically renew should also be provided as a payment option.
Such a payment method could have a different price (i.e a discount for prepurchasing a long membership).

Both the customer and the business staff should be able to see how much longer a customer has on their membership.
